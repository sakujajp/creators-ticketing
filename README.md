## Requirements

- PHP 8.3 or higher

- Filament 5.0 or higher
- Livewire 4.0 or higher

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:
```bash
composer require daacreators/creators-ticketing
```

After installation, publish the config file:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="creators-ticketing-config"
```

### Setup: Filament Panel Integration

The plugin integration code should be added to your main Filament admin panel provider file, which is typically located at:
```
app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php
```

Open your AdminPanelProvider.php file and modify the panel() method as shown below:
```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\PanelProvider;
use daacreators\CreatorsTicketing\TicketingPlugin;

class AdminPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
{
    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
            ->default()
            ->plugins([
                TicketingPlugin::make(),
            ]);
    }
}
```

Run the migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Seeding Ticket Statuses

After running migrations, you can seed default ticket statuses using the provided seeder:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=daacreators\\CreatorsTicketing\\Database\\Seeders\\TicketStatusSeeder
```

This will create the following default ticket statuses:
- **Open** (Blue) - Default status for new tickets
- **In Progress** (Amber) - Tickets being worked on
- **Answered** (Green) - Tickets that have been answered
- **Pending** (Purple) - Tickets waiting for response
- **Resolved** (Green) - Tickets that have been resolved
- **Closed** (Gray) - Closing status for completed tickets

The seeder uses `updateOrCreate` to prevent duplicates, so you can safely run it multiple times.

## Upgrading

### Upgrading from v1.1.8 to v1.1.9
**⚠️ Important:** Version v1.1.9 and introduces new fields to the database table. If you are upgrading from a previous version, you **must** run the migrations after updating the package to ensure the system functions correctly:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Configure the package by setting values in your `.env` file or directly in the `config/creators-ticketing.php` file:
```php
TICKETING_NAV_GROUP="Creators Ticketing"

USER_MODEL="\App\Models\User"

TICKETING_NAV_FIELD=email
TICKETING_NAV_ALLOWED=admin@demo.com,manager@demo.com
```

### UUID / ULID / Nanoid user IDs

This package now creates `user_id`, `assignee_id`, and `seen_by` columns using the configured user ID type.

- **UUID**: no extra config needed (default for non-int keys)
- **ULID**: no extra config needed if your user model uses `HasUlids`
- **Custom string (e.g. nanoid)**: set the key type + length so foreign keys match your `users.id`

```php
TICKETING_USER_KEY_TYPE=char
TICKETING_USER_KEY_LENGTH=21
```

### Navigation Visibility

You can control who sees the ticketing resources in the admin panel by configuring the navigation visibility rules:
```php
'navigation_visibility' => [
    'field' => 'email',
    'allowed' => ['admin@site.com', 'manager@site.com']
],
```

## Multi-language Support

This plugin is fully localized and supports multiple languages out of the box. It automatically detects and uses your application's current locale configuration (`config/app.php`).

**Currently supported languages:**

- 🇺🇸 **English** (`en`) - Default
- 🇪🇸 **Spanish** (`es`)
- 🇧🇷 **Portuguese (Brazil)** (`pt_BR`)
- 🇫🇷 **French** (`fr`)
- 🇩🇪 **German** (`de`)
- 🇸🇦 **Arabic** (`ar`)
- 🇨🇳 **Chinese (Simplified)** (`zh_CN`)

### Publishing Translations

If you wish to modify the texts or add a new language, you can publish the translation files:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="creators-ticketing-translations"
```

## Usage

### Creating Forms

1. Go to the Forms section in the admin panel
2. Create a new form with custom fields

### Setting Up Departments

1. Navigate to the Filament admin panel
2. Go to the Departments section
3. Create departments and assign agents
4. Assign the form to specific departments

### Frontend Integration

To add the tickets and ticket submission form to your frontend:
```blade
@livewire('creators-ticketing.ticket-submit-form')
```

## Dashboard Widget

The package includes a ticket statistics widget. Add it to your Filament dashboard:
```php
use daacreators\CreatorsTicketing\Filament\Widgets\TicketStatsWidget;

class DashboardConfig extends Config
{
    public function widgets(): array
    {
        return [
            TicketStatsWidget::class,
        ];
    }
}
```

## Events System

The plugin dispatches events for major ticket actions, allowing you to extend functionality with custom listeners.

### Available Events

All events are located in the `daacreators\CreatorsTicketing\Events` namespace:

### Viewing Spam Logs

All blocked submissions are logged with complete details:

## Security

The package includes built-in security features:
- Private file storage for attachments
- Permission-based access control
- Department-level agent restrictions

Note: attachments require `storage/app/private` to be writable by the PHP process. On some hosts (WSL/Docker/NFS bind mounts), permission changes like `chmod` may be denied; the package will continue to boot, but you must ensure correct ownership/permissions from the host.
